# **Optimal Routing Protocol and Deployment Strategy for Multi-UAV Relay Networks**

## **Introduction**  

Communication infrastructure is a fundamental pillar of modern society, yet it remains highly vulnerable to **wars, natural disasters, and large-scale social unrest**, where traditional terrestrial networks can be easily disrupted. In the event of earthquakes, floods, or military conflicts, **ground-based cellular and wired networks may become inoperable**, severely limiting communication capabilities. While **satellite communication** can serve as an alternative, **high deployment costs, excessive latency, and the requirement for specialized terminals (Satellite Terminals) make it impractical for widespread use.**  

In contrast, **Multi-UAV Relay Networks** present a **cost-effective and rapidly deployable solution that enables seamless communication using existing smartphonesâ€”without requiring additional hardware**. These networks can be **deployed instantly in affected areas and expanded dynamically by adding more UAVs, ensuring continuous coverage with high scalability**. Furthermore, **compared to satellite communication, UAV relay networks offer significantly lower latency, enabling real-time applications such as military operations, disaster response, and remote control systems.**  

However, **to ensure the efficiency and reliability of UAV-based networks, optimizing both UAV deployment strategy and routing protocols is essential**. A well-optimized system must **maintain network connectivity, minimize frequency interference, and prevent network congestion**, all while dynamically adapting to changing conditions.  

This research focuses on **integrating optimal routing protocols and deployment strategies within Multi-UAV Relay Networks**, aiming to **deliver a high-performance, resilient communication system for disaster-stricken areas, battlefields, and regions lacking traditional network infrastructure**.
